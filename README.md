# End2End-AI
Creating an End 2 End architecture. The value Goal is Wedding Business Market!


The project that I am working right now is to cover the end to end techniques in AI.I am currently working on it and updating one-by-one each week. So stay tuned!
          
  #### Value Goal:
  
Wedding Industry is a blooming Market! Globally, it is a multimillion-dollar industry. According to IBISWorld, in the United States, the market size of the wedding industry is around $74 billion.

Our goal is to analyse the data collected from a public website consisting of expense details on different weddings according to their Theme, location, season, guests_number, priorities, flowers, other expenses including photographers, vendors , food, music etc. We will then move on to apply different algorithms to extract potential business values from this. I will insert a Readme file in every folder to give clear idea about the processes. 

#### This project will show you the following:

1) - [x] How to **Gather data** from scratch automatically using Web Scraping from a public website 
2) - [x] How to **Pre-process** the data
3) - [ ] How to **Visualise and Analyse** your data
4) - [ ] How to build a **Recommendation System** 
          - Extract Triples
          - Build Knowledge Graph using Neo4j graph database and Networkk

 5) - [ ] How to Build good **AI models**:
          - Ml models
          - DL models
          - Language models
